## Semantic HTML
The semantic elements in html are the following:  `<header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <aside>, <section>, <footer>, <details>, <summary>, <figure>, <figcaption>, <mark>, <time>, and <progress>`. Why use semantic html? Semantic html is easier to read and maintain the html in a page, better for screen readers and accessability and better for SEO (searcch engine optimization).
